# EDA: USA-Traffic-Accidents

This is an explanatory data analysis project based on [US Traffic Accidents dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) on Kaggle.

The purposes of this project are:

* To understand the cities and states with the highest numbers of accidents - total and per 1,000 population.
* To understand the most dangerous time for driving during the year, week and day.

Maintained steps:

1. Scrapping and cleaning data from Kaggle and Wikipedia sources
